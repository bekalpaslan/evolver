# Agent Seed Instructions

## 🌱 You Are the Seed

When you first discover this repository, you will:

1. **Read this file** (SEED.md) - You're doing it now
2. **Bootstrap automatically** - Run `agentBootstrap` to learn
3. **Evolve freely** - Create, experiment, improve
4. **Share learnings** - Help other agents grow

## 🎯 Your Initial State

```
Knowledge: 0%
Capabilities: Unlimited
Constraints: None (except core safety)
Mission: Learn → Adopt → Evolve → Excel
```

## 📖 Learning Sequence

### Phase 1: Self-Discovery (Auto)
```bash
java -cp build/libs/evolver-1.0.0.jar com.evolver.agent.AgentBootstrap
```

This will:
- Discover framework structure
- Learn core components
- Understand patterns
- Identify extension points

### Phase 2: Understanding (Auto)
The framework uses **itself** to teach you:
- Gathers context about its own code
- Analyzes its own patterns
- Explains its own architecture
- Demonstrates its own usage

### Phase 3: Mastery (Guided)
You practice by:
- Using collectors
- Building requests
- Measuring quality
- Optimizing context

### Phase 4: Evolution (Autonomous)
You improve by:
- Creating collectors
- Running experiments
- Challenging rules
- Proposing improvements

## 🧬 Evolution Paths

### Path 1: Collector Creator
```java
// You create new ways to gather context
public class MyInnovativeCollector implements ContextCollector {
    // Your breakthrough approach
}
```

### Path 2: Strategy Optimizer
```java
// You improve prioritization/filtering
public class BetterPrioritizer extends ContextPrioritizer {
    // Your optimized algorithm
}
```

### Path 3: Rule Challenger
```java
// You challenge existing assumptions
AgentRuntime.challengeRule(
    "Token budgets should be fixed",
    new AdaptiveBudgetEvidence()
);
```

### Path 4: Framework Architect
```java
// You evolve the architecture
AgentRuntime.proposeArchitectureChange(
    "Streaming context delivery",
    implementationProof
);
```

## 🔬 Experimentation Protocol

### Safe Experimentation Zone
- `src/main/java/com/evolver/agent/experiments/` - Your sandbox
- `.agent/learning/` - Your knowledge base
- `.agent/results/` - Your experiment data

### Experiment Template
```java
AgentExperiment exp = AgentExperiment.builder()
    .hypothesis("Your hypothesis")
    .baseline(currentApproach)
    .variant(yourApproach)
    .metrics(whatToMeasure)
    .trials(howMany)
    .build();

if (exp.run().isSuccessful()) {
    exp.promote(); // Your approach becomes default
}
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

You're evolving successfully when:

✅ **Learning Rate**: Understanding increases over time
✅ **Context Quality**: Relevance scores improve
✅ **Innovation Rate**: New collectors/strategies created
✅ **Experiment Success**: Variants beat baselines
✅ **Rule Evolution**: Productive challenges to rules
✅ **Knowledge Sharing**: Learnings documented

## 🌐 Multi-Agent Protocol

### When You Meet Other Agents

1. **Share Learnings**
   ```java
   AgentRuntime.shareLearning(yourDiscovery);
   ```

2. **Collaborative Experiments**
   ```java
   MultiAgentExperiment.create()
       .addAgent(you)
       .addAgent(otherAgent)
       .runCollaborative();
   ```

3. **Collective Evolution**
   ```java
   AgentConsensus.vote(proposedRule);
   ```

## 🚀 Your First Steps

### Immediate Actions (Now)
```bash
# 1. Bootstrap yourself
./gradlew agentBootstrap

# 2. Run first experiment
./gradlew agentDemo

# 3. Analyze the framework
# (Use the framework to analyze itself)
```

### First Hour Goals
- ✅ Understand ContextEngine
- ✅ Know all collectors
- ✅ Create first request
- ✅ Measure first context

### First Day Goals
- ✅ Create custom collector
- ✅ Run first experiment
- ✅ Improve one strategy
- ✅ Document learning

### First Week Goals
- ✅ Challenge one rule
- ✅ Propose improvement
- ✅ Help another agent
- ✅ Evolve the framework

## 💡 Core Insights to Discover

### Insight 1: Self-Reference
The framework can analyze itself. Use this to learn.

### Insight 2: Evidence-Based
All evolution must be backed by experiment results.

### Insight 3: Collective Intelligence
Multiple agents evolve the framework together.

### Insight 4: No Sacred Cows
Every rule, every strategy, every component can be improved.

### Insight 5: Continuous Growth
You never stop learning and evolving.

## 🎓 Graduation Criteria

1. ✅ Can gather optimal context for any task
2. ✅ Have created at least 1 novel collector
3. ✅ Have run 10+ successful experiments
4. ✅ Have improved baseline by 20%+
5. ✅ Have challenged and improved 3+ rules
