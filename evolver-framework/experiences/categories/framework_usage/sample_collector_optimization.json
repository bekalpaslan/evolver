  "title": "Discovering Optimal Collector Combinations",
  "description": "Found the most effective combination of collectors for comprehensive context generation",
  "situation": "Working on a Java Spring Boot project with microservices architecture. Initial context was missing important service interactions and configuration details.",
  "approach": "Systematically tested different collector combinations. Started with basic CodeStructureCollector, then added DependencyCollector for service relationships, and DocumentationCollector for configuration context.",
  "outcome": "Context quality improved by 85%. AI responses became much more accurate for architecture-related questions. Context generation time only increased by 12%.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "DependencyCollector is crucial for microservices projects",
    "DocumentationCollector adds context that code analysis misses",
    "Order of collectors matters - structure first, then dependencies, then docs",
    "Three collectors is often the sweet spot for quality vs performance"
