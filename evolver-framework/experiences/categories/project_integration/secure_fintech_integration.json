  "description": "Strategy for safely integrating with high-security financial applications without compromising existing security measures",
  "situation": "Fintech startup with strict security requirements, PCI compliance, extensive audit trails. Existing security framework couldn't be modified. Framework needed to integrate without any security implications.",
  "approach": "Created security-aware collectors that respect existing permissions. Implemented audit logging for all context operations. Added encrypted context storage and secure deletion. Integrated with existing authentication system.",
  "outcome": "Passed security audit with zero issues. Framework integration was invisible to security team. Context quality remained high while maintaining full compliance. No performance impact on security operations.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "Security integration requires deep understanding of existing security architecture",
    "Audit logging must be comprehensive and tamper-proof", 
    "Context encryption should use organization's existing key management",
    "Permission checking must happen at every collection point",
    "Integration should enhance, never bypass, existing security"
